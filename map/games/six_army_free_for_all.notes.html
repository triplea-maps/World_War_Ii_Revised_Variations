A scenario built for a game with no alliances, with China added to the Asian theatre.

		<br> a few rules are found below...
		<br> #1.no attacking a capital on turn 1 of any kind is allowed, not even strategic bombing.
		<br> #2.no more than five units may be placed in each territory during your bid placement phase, with the exception of placement into your capital, or placing a navy.
		<br> #3.all naval units MUST be placed in a seazone adjacent to an industrial complex that you own (you may place units in seazones next to bid-purchased industrial complexes.
		<br> house rules are subject to the host of the game's approval. 
		<br> have fun! (remember to place your bids in a balanced fashion...diplomacy sometimes fails!
