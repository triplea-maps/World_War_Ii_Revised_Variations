A WW2V2 Revised mod that follows the popular LHTR rules. (Larry Harris Tournament Rules)
					<br>
					<br>NOTE: If playing with tech, do NOT research "Industrial Technology", as technically that is not one of the techs for this game, and it is also considered an unbalanced tech.
					<br>
					<br>Summary of Major Changes from normal Revised to LHTR:
					<br>* AA guns do not fire if moved over during non-combat movement phase.
					<br>* Strategic Bombing Raids and Rockets can not do more damage per territory than the value of that territory, per turn.
					<br>* You can no longer move air units from a territory to the carrier when you place a new carrier, 
							instead you must move those air units to the territory where the carrier will be placed during one of the movement phases, then place the carrier under it during placement phase.
					<br>* You may place purchased air units on already existing carriers in sea zones adjacent to the factory, (and also still on purchased carriers), during placement phase.
					<br>* Technology is given to the player at the end of their turn, instead of immediately after it is researched at the beginning of the turn.
					<br>* Super Subs gives +1 attack and +1 defense, instead of just attack, to submarines.
					<br>* Heavy Bombers allows bombers to roll 2 dice, and select the best one (instead of counting both), and if a strategic bombing raid, +1 is added onto the best die in order to calculate total damage.
					<br>* No Industrial Technology tech
